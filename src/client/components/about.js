            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a second-year masterâ€™s student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, with an expected graduation in May 2025.

            <p>
              Prior to joining Vanderbilt, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Information Engineering from the College of Electrical Engineering at Zhejiang University. In addition, I obtained a Second Major Certificate in Computer Science and Technology from the same institution. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in the Asian Regional Contest of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) at the Nanjing Site, where I was honored with a Gold Medal.

              My academic and professional interests lie in the development of web applications. I have contributed to several projects, including Architectura Sinica, News Sentiment Analyzer, and an Online Consultation Platform, gaining experience in both front-end and back-end technologies.
